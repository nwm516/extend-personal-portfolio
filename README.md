# Extend Personal Portfolio App with Expo Image Picker
This was an assignment for my Mobile Application Development class.

Objective: "Enhance your existing personal portfolio app by integrating Expo Image Picker"

I ended up using photos within my phone's Gallery as profile pictures to change out with since Expo already had access to my phone's memory.
