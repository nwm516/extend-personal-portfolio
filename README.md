# Extend Personal Portfolio App with Expo Image Picker
This was an assignment for my Mobile Application Development class.

Objective: "Enhance your existing personal portfolio app by integrating Expo Image Picker"

I ended up using photos within my phone's Gallery as profile pictures to change out with. I decided against going with a set of predetermined photos to work with since Expo already seemed to be tapping into my phone's Gallery.
